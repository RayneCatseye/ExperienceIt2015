# Sentiment Analysis in a rush

In October 2015 I ran a workshop as part of Experience It!, covering the computer science element of engineering. 

## What is "Experience It!"?

Experience It! Is an engineering day for girls in years 9-12.

"Come along to join other interested girls in hands-on workshops, career talks and Q&A sessions, run by staff and students from multiple universities and industry partners.

Together we will explore the many opportunities that engineering offers, and you can see what interests you most."

The Experience It! program is run by Engineers Australia.

## What did I do?

I decided to teach the students sentiment analysis, as it was a fun, relevant and widely customisable problem for them to tackle. I hoped to inspire them to see that computer science is a field that can be used in interesting and unexpected ways, not just to write big systems and crunch numbers. 

I assumed no prior knowledge of Python, and hoped that the notes and guidelines I provided were enough for the students to work out what needed to be done.

With only one hour, it was difficult to pick something that had a small problem base, wriggle room for customisation AND was interesting to do outside writing code. This seemed to fit the criterion, and was great fun for the students involved.
